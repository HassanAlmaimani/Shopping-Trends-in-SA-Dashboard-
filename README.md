## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### 1. Data Preparation (Microsoft Excel)

The raw dataset was rigorously cleaned in Excel before being imported into Power BI. Key steps included:

* **Cleansing:** Handling null values, correcting data entry errors (typos), and removing duplicate records.
* **Transformation:** Standardizing text fields (e.g., product names and regions) and ensuring numerical columns were correctly formatted.
* **Structuring:** Creating a clean, flat table suitable for immediate import and modeling in Power BI.

### 2. Visualization (Power BI)

Power BI was used to model the data and design the visual layer:

* **Modeling:** The clean Excel data was imported as the primary data source, and necessary relationships (though minimal for this flat file structure) and basic DAX measures were created.
* **Visuals:** Key visuals include stacked bar charts for demographic analysis, a line chart for regional performance over a time-like sequence, and a stacked area chart to show sales contribution.
